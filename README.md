Hi There! 👋 

Hi, I’m saki606. I'm trained in theoretical mathematics, thermofluid dynamics, coastal engineering, and data science.

I work as an research engineer in a Japanese based industrial machinery manufacturer.
Saved here are some sample codes I like to keep handy for personal / professional use.

- 👀 Interests: Algebra-Geometry hybrid (ex. geometric group theory), liquid-gas two phase flow, computational fluid dynamics, machine learning and data engineering.
- 🌱 Learning: Machine Learning applications to industrial and financial processes.
- 💞️ Collaboration: Anything fun!
- 📫 Contact: saki606@gmail.com . . . though I'm a bit shy with my responses.
